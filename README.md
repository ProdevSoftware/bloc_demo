## Features

- **Bloc Pattern**: Utilizes the Bloc pattern for managing state in the application.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates UI components from business logic, making code easier to maintain and test.
- **Asynchronous Events**: Handles asynchronous events such as fetching data from APIs.
- **Simple User Fetch Example**: Includes a simple user fetch example to illustrate basic usage of Bloc.
